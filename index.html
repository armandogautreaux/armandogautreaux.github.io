          Hello, my name is Armando and I have created this website as part of my first homework assignment from the SMU Coding Program.
          The present theme is made up of 3 parts. The first page, is this site (index.html). It includes a navigation bar
          at the top with some hover effects, a main content section, displaying general information about the website, and
          a basic footer with an achor link, which will return a user to this homepage anytime it is selected.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second page is called portfolio, and includes some random pictures that represent future projects that I will develop
          during this academic program.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, the last part of this Website is a contact section, where, I have added a simple contact form where people who have
          questions about my projects can reach out to me. Overall, this is what this website is all about. Thank You for
          reading.
        </p>
